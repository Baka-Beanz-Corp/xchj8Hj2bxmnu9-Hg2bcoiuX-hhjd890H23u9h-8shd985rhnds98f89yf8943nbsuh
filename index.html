        <h1>Information about the 'Baka Beanz Corp'<br><br></h1>
        <b>Baka Beanz Corp is a fictional corporation that is used in the anime series 'Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu' written by Yumoto and his boyfriend, Chisaki Kyouga.
            I wrote it for fun but also for an AU so if you don't mind I'm using this as inspiration for the plot of the first episode. It's just some character studies from my point of view because I can' t do anything with the story other than use some of the characters for example the characters from Baka to Shoukanjuu who are real people. If you want the full storyline please read the first chapter or chapter two of my other book 'Shoukanjuu to test to Shoukanjuu' written by Aomine Daiki.
            This will be the second half of the first part of the series so please keep the rest of the stories in the same place! Thank you and I hope you enjoyed reading my work. :)

            Chapter 2
            "Hajime, can you hand me the remote?" Hajime called out without looking up from where he had been sitting. 
            He knew exactly what his husband was talking about, because the tv had been set to rerun some episodes of their favorite series since they got back home. 
            "What are you watching?" Hajime asked as he grabbed his own remote from his nightstand, pressing the pause button. 
            "The last season of Baka." Kousuke replied, taking his seat next to him.
            "Oh..." Hajime said, glancing at the screen briefly. He didn't understand why his husband always watched that show, especially since there were many more better shows on Netflix.
            The last time he had checked, the television channel was showing 'Fangirls Edition'.
            Kousuke sighed and reached over to turn off the TV, before laying down next to Hajime on the couch and wrapping an arm around his waist.
            "Why are you acting all grumpy now? I thought I told you we were going to watch a movie tonight?" His husband asked teasingly.
            Hajime groaned quietly before leaning his head against Kousuke's shoulder. "You did say we were, but not until later. What are we gonna watch anyway?" 
            "How about we watch The Conjuring again?"
            "Fine..." Hajime grumbled, giving into Kousuke' s requests.
            It would never happen though. Even when they started dating, Hajime still refused to watch the show with his husband, although now that he had met the boy who was meant to be his future partner he could no longer say no to his lover.
            Especially considering how cute the boy looked during his performance in the show.
            Even though he refused to admit it, he adored Kousuke's cooking too. He always loved eating food Kousuke cooked; every little thing Kousuke made was perfect.
            But today wasn't the day for him to focus on food. Today was the day he wanted to spend with his husband.
            "So," Hajime spoke softly after a while. "Did you have a good day today? Are the kids being good?"
            "Yes. They are." Kousuke replied as he kissed Hajime's forehead. "They helped me take care of everything in our room. We're doing well enough on that front."
            "Good. And you're sure you're alright here alone?"
            "Yes, I'll be fine." Kousuke repeated himself, smiling brightly. "As long as I have you with me everything will be fine."
            Chapter 3
            Kakeru woke up the next morning to the sound of someone knocking on the door. At first he thought nothing of it, hoping that whoever it was could wait until Kakeru got up. But when it became clear the person wouldn't stop knocking and wouldn't leave unless he answered it, Kakeru decided to investigate it.
            The door was still slightly open which caused Kakeru to peer outside the room quickly to make sure there wasn't a problem. He took one step out of the room and then another before stopping once he heard a familiar voice coming from the living room.
            He couldn't understand a word the man was saying, but he could pick out one thing from it. That man sounded angry. Kakeru immediately felt a small sense of dread grow in the pit of his stomach.
            There hadn't been any incidents lately, but Kakeru knew better than anyone else that sometimes bad things could happen on a peaceful day, even at times when there weren't any threats.
            It was almost as if someone was trying to scare him.
            And it probably was; everyone else was convinced that Kakeru was afraid of something or someone, and Kakeru certainly wasn't.
            Still, he couldn't ignore the fact that whoever was speaking seemed to be angry at him. Not only that, the person who was speaking seemed to know where Kakeru lived, which was very strange. Usually, if Kakeru wasn't careful, someone would figure out where he lived fairly easily due to all the houses on his street and he usually tried to avoid those houses as much as possible.
            But it didn't seem as if he had done so recently, and the most likely explanation was that Kakeru' s house had somehow gotten leaked somehow. Which would explain why the unknown person was standing outside his house shouting, though he didn't think that was really the reason.
            Kakeru turned around and headed back inside his room. He shut the door behind him and locked it, not wanting his parents, who he knew were still sleeping downstairs, to worry. After locking the door, he climbed into bed and pulled his covers up to his chin, making himself comfortable.
            The man was obviously upset with him, and if Kakeru was lucky, Kakeru could avoid having to talk to him for the rest of the afternoon.
            Unfortunately for Kakeru, luck wasn' t one to run out on him anytime soon. Not ten minutes passed before the banging continued, growing louder each passing moment.
            "Please stop! Just leave!" Kakeru shouted through the wall, trying to cover his ears as loud as possible.
            After he realized he was doing little to help the situation, he rolled onto his side and pressed his palms against his eyes in frustration. He hated this kind of stuff. This wasn't like elementary school; when there were bullies he didn't have to hide under his desk to deal with them.
            He needed to find a way to calm his neighbors down; otherwise Kakeru was certain they'd be called the police.
            With nothing else to do, Kakeru began looking for something to distract him. Eventually he came across his phone charger, which he plugged in to charge. With that taken care of, he moved to stand up, intending to go get changed, when he felt himself getting dizzy and stumbled backwards, landing hard on his bottom.
            His head throbbed in pain.
            "Ugh... what's happening to me?" Kakeru mumbled, his eyes closed and his arms held up in front of his face protectively. His body ached all over, and his head hurt worse than ever before.
            He couldn' t remember how he got here, much less what caused the headache that was currently plaguing him.
            "I'm scared..." Kakeru whispered, feeling tears spring to his eyes. How was this possible? He didn't even remember falling asleep. Wasn't he just lying on the floor watching a cartoon? "I'm scared!" He cried.
            Kakeru buried his face in his hands as his tears streamed freely from his eyes. He didn' t know where he was or what was happening to him. If he stayed like this his parents might suspect something was wrong, and then they'd lock him away in a psych ward and he'd end up dying of old age by the time he was twenty.
            "I don' t want to die!" Kakeru sobbed. "I don' t want to die!"
            He didn't know how long he sat there crying, but eventually he managed to calm down enough to pull himself together.
            He wiped his eyes and sniffled loudly, wiping his nose on the sleeve of his t shirt. Once he was certain he could breathe normally again, he stood up slowly, not wanting to fall back down.
            Slowly, painfully slowly, Kakeru limped his way over to the bathroom, wincing at the ache in his legs and feet. Once inside the bathroom, he stripped and got ready for school. Then he walked back into his bedroom to grab his uniform.
            As soon as his hand touched the fabric, he instantly dropped it and backed away from it.
            A chill went down his spine. 
            He remembered.
            When he was five years old, he had found one of his brother' s old t shirts underneath their bed. As soon as he had put it on, he fell backwards, hitting his head and blacking out. When he came to, his father was holding him against his chest, telling him that everything was okay.
            Kakeru had believed it then, because he was a child and what he remembered was normal. However the following week, his parents had taken him to the doctor's office to check if he'd suffered any head trauma or any lasting damage. And the doctor said his memory loss was nothing unusual; he'd just lost a bit more of it since he was younger. He hadn't gone through a traumatic experience since then, so it was quite possible that Kakeru had lost some memories in the past few weeks.
            Which explained why his head was pounding so badly right now.
            However, even knowing that wasn't the case didn't change the fact that he felt fear creep up on him. He didn't like feeling scared, especially not when he wasn't aware of anything that was going on around him.
            He'd never experienced something like this in his whole life.
            This could only mean one thing: the stranger who attacked him last night had found his house. 
            Kakeru swallowed nervously; the idea of an intruder creeping into his home terrified him beyond measure. What did he do? What should he do?
            Should he call for his parents? No, it would just make everything worse if someone came and told them what happened. Besides, Kakeru would prefer to handle this on his own. Maybe it was his imagination, maybe there was nothing to worry about, but Kakeru just had a feeling about this incident.
            Maybe his mind was trying to tell him that something terrible was about to happen to him.
            Kakeru stared silently out of the window, wondering when his brother would come to fetch him. It was already past two o'clock. The sun had barely risen. Shouldn't he be up by now?
            He waited a couple more minutes until he heard something moving around outside the house.
            "Hey! Is somebody here?!"
            Kakeru jumped at the sudden shout and quickly rushed over towards his window. Looking out carefully, he saw the man leaning against his car, his hat pushed back and his hair sticking up all over the place. There were large bags filled to the brim with luggage beside him, the suitcase he'd seen on TV the night before still sitting there.
            What is he doing here?! 
            Even though Kakeru could tell the man wanted nothing more than to leave as soon as possible, he forced himself to remain calm and speak calmly to the man.
            "Excuse me, sir," Kakeru began, hoping the man could hear the uncertainty in his voice. "Do you need anything?" He asked, trying to sound convincing even if he was shaking slightly on the inside.
            "Yes, I do." The man nodded, looking as serious as he possibly could. "Is your mother awake?"
            Kakeru frowned. His mother was never asleep this early. She usually started her day early, usually around nine thirty. She often said that she was too tired after work to get any sleep, and she always made sure she had lots of coffee before she went to bed.
            So why was the man asking if she was awake this early? Did he suspect that someone was hiding in the house somewhere?
